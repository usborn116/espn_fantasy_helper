This app helps you decide how a trade will affect your team.

First, you will want to open the "trade_machine.py" file and input your own league's ID, SWID, and S2D number.

You will need to install Flask, flask_sqlalchemy, the espn_api, requests, and pandas. To run it locally, you
will also want to install virtualenv via pip. Initiate a virtual environment, install the dependencies, and then run the file!
